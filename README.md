# 🤖 Smooth Motion Robot Arm Controller (CircuitPython)

This project controls a 4-servo robot arm using CircuitPython and the PCA9685 PWM controller. It features **ease-in/ease-out smoothed motion**, keyboard-based control, and the ability to **record, save, and replay motion sequences**.

Designed for hobby robotics, creative coding, and educational demonstrations.

## 🔧 Features

- 🔁 **Control 4 servos**: base rotation, shoulder, elbow, and gripper
- ⌨️ **Keyboard interface** over USB serial (e.g., via Mu editor or screen)
- 🎞️ **Record and replay** motion sequences
- 🧈 **Smooth, eased motion** using cubic interpolation
- 🔇 **Deadband filtering** to reduce servo noise and jitter
- 💾 **Save motion sequences** to a `.json` file on the microcontroller
- 🧠 Future-ready: can be adapted for AI, remote control, or sensors

---

## 🧰 Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller running **CircuitPython** (e.g., Feather, QT Py, etc.)
- **PCA9685 16-Channel PWM Servo Driver** (Adafruit or compatible)
- 4x standard 180° servos
- External power source for servos (recommended)
- USB connection to computer for keyboard control

## 🕹️ Controls

Once the script is running, you can control the robot arm through the serial console:

| Key      | Function                |
|----------|-------------------------|
| `q/a`    | Base rotation (left/right) |
| `w/s`    | Shoulder (up/down)      |
| `e/d`    | Elbow (up/down)         |
| `r/f`    | Gripper open/close      |
| `SPACE`  | Record current pose     |
| `z`      | Save sequence to `sequence.json` |
| `x`      | Replay recorded sequence |

## 🧠 Motion Smoothing
Motion is smoothed using a cubic **ease-in/ease-out** curve:
```python
ease_in_out(t) = 3t² - 2t³
This creates natural, organic movement over a series of small interpolated steps, rather than abrupt 5° jumps.

💾 Saving and Replaying Sequences
While controlling the robot manually:

Press SPACE to record key poses

Press z to save the sequence

Press x to replay your recorded motion

Recorded motions are stored in a JSON file and include servo angles and timing.

🔧 Customization
You can expand this project to include:

Remote control via BLE or WiFi

Joystick or touchscreen input

AI gesture generation or remote execution

More servos (up to 16 with PCA9685!)

🧪 Known Limitations
Only works over USB/serial keyboard interface

Basic terminal must be used (Mu editor or screen)

No safety limits beyond 0–180° range—ensure servos are mounted safely
